# CyberPyBlocker

CyberPyBlocker is a lightweight encrypted blockchain framework written in Python for secure data storage. It utilizes cryptography, scrypt, and hashlib to secure data. This is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well. This is a work in progress and as of now it should be built off and extended to become more powerful.

### Introduction

CyberPyBlocker is a lightweight encrypted blockchain framework written in Python for secure data storage. It utilizes cryptography, scrypt, and hashlib to secure data. This project is intended to help the cybersecurity world by providing a secure data storage solution that is easy to use and understand. CyberPyBlocker is unique in that it provides a secure and lightweight solution that does not require a large amount of resources.

### Goals
- Create a secure data storage solution that is easy to use and understand
- Utilize cryptography, scrypt, and hashlib to secure data
- Provide a lightweight solution that does not require a large amount of resources
- Develop a prototype that can be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become

### Roadmap
- Develop an encryption algorithm for secure data storage
- Create a lightweight blockchain framework using Python
- Implement a user interface for secure data storage
- Integrate the encryption algorithm with the blockchain framework
- Test the prototype and make any necessary improvements

### API
This project utilizes a few closed-source APIs. As these APIs are closed source, they are a work in progress and likely will not be released to the public due to licensing agreements. Therefore, someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs used.
